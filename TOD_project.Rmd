## requirements

Transit Oriented Development (TOD) is a transportation planning concept which promotes
developing communities around public transportation. This is believed to improve the 
quality of life of residents and generate business by making cities more walkable, clean, and dense. On the macro level, it is believed to increase land value
and make transit systems more efficient. In recent years, a number of cities have invested in TOD, including Boston, Massachusetts. In the past decade, the Massachusetts
Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA)

, which operates public transportation in the 
Greater Boston region, has worked with private developers and the city to support
more than 50 TOD projects around its stations.

- widely known that households value transit-rich neighborhoods
  - benefits
  - example of current work in this area (MPC)
  - example of cities
  - background of Boston's TOD, station/line setup
  
  This makes Boston an interesting case for studying the effects of TOD. In this 
  brief, we analyze the relationship between TOD and neighborhood value. 


1.Show your data wrangling work.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(scipen=999)
options(tigris_class = "sf")


install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("tidycensus")
library(tidycensus)
library(sf)
library(kableExtra)

```

2.Four small-multiple (2000 & 2017+) visualizations comparing four selected Census variables across time and space (TOD vs. non-TOD).


3.One grouped bar plot making these same comparisons.


4.One table making these same comparisons.


5.Create two graduated symbol maps of population and rent within 0.5 mile of each transit station. Google for more information, but a graduate symbol map represents quantities for each transit station proportionally.

6.Create a geom_line plot that shows mean rent as a function of distance to subway stations (Figure x.x.x). To do this you will need to use the multipleRingBuffer function in the ppaR package.


7.Download and wrangle point-level crime data (pick a crime type). What is the relationship between crime, transit access and rents



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
